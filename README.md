# AI-Tools
Tools to customize and effortlessly use advanced AI tools. Runs entirely on the user's own device. The default AI settings of the projects I create and contribute to are decided by a Simulation made from closed source and mathematical/scientific methods.

# Current Projects:

> [!WARNING]
> You may see Google ads on the project pages, but this is very limited so as not to be intrusive, and the minimal revenues from Google ads will only be used for the development of the project and server costs.

> [!CAUTION]
> Tools that are dangerous to humanity and difficult to control cannot be released for development here. For these, legal limits must be established.

# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! To ensure a consistent and efficient development process, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1.  **Adding New Pages and AI Tools:**
    *   When adding a new page or AI tool, please strictly follow the **coding structure and standards of the existing Content Management System (CMS)**. This is vital for maintaining project consistency.
    *   As a contributor, you are welcome to **add your name to the description section at the bottom** of the page or tool you created.
    *   Since the main project will be hosted on my primary website, delivering a **high-quality and seamless User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX)** to end-users is a top priority. Please ensure your contributions align with this goal.
    *   You must add the [Google ads code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tryigit/AI-Tools/refs/heads/main/adscode.txt) correctly when opening the project.

> [!TIP]
> You can use a dark theme for tools that may require prolonged screen time (such as AI Translate).

2.  **Code Integrity and Avoiding Duplication:**
    *   There is a future plan to **consolidate all tools onto a single "All Tools" page**. In light of this objective, please act in accordance with the project's nature and **refrain from duplicating code or creating unnecessary forks** of the existing structure.
    *   Focus on writing clean, easily integrable code. Unnecessary complexity will only complicate current maintenance and the future integration process.

3.  **Runtime Environment and Technology:**
    *   All developed tools **must be designed to run client-side**, executing within the user's web browser. Server-side dependencies for the core functionality should be avoided.
    *   **Technology Notes:**
        *   While `PHP` is not the ideal choice for purely client-side execution, its potential relevance for future backend interactions or API planning is noted. However, the immediate development focus must remain **strictly on the browser-side**.
        *   For ensuring security and performance in browser-based applications, **JavaScript** (along with relevant frameworks/libraries like React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.) or technologies such as WebAssembly are generally the preferred choices. Please refer to the existing codebase for guidance on established standards and technological preferences.
